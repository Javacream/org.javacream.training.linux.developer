Before it was named, grep was a private utility written by Ken Thompson to search files for certain patterns. 
Doug McIlroy, unaware of its existence, asked Thompson to write such a program. 
Responding that he would think about such a utility overnight, Thompson actually corrected bugs and made improvements for about an hour. 
The next day he presented the program to McIlroy, who said it was exactly what he wanted. 
Thompson's account may explain the belief that grep was written overnight.[6]
Thompson wrote the first version in PDP-11 assembly language to help Lee E. McMahon analyze the text of the Federalist Papers to determine authorship of the individual papers.[7] The ed text editor (also authored by Thompson) had regular expression support but could not be used on such a large amount of text, so Thompson excerpted that code into a standalone tool.[1] He chose the name because in ed, the command g/re/p would print all lines matching a specified pattern.[8][9] grep was first included in Version 4 Unix. Stating that it is "generally cited as the prototypical software tool", McIlroy credited grep with "irrevocably ingraining" Thompson's tools philosophy in Unix.[10]
